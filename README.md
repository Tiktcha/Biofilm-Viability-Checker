# Biofilm-Viability-Checker

//This macro processes multiple images in a folder, outputting the number of bacteria pixels in the red channel and the green channel respectively to calculate the 
//viability of a biofilm stained with red and green viability stains. 
//It also saves overlay images showing the bacteria which have been detected.
//See "Supplementary Information" file for details on how to run and implement the macro.
